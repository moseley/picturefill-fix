Adds WP Retina 2x picturefill compatibility for WooCommerce variable product images.

== Description ==

If you love WooCommerce and WP Retina 2x you have likely ran into an issue on variable product pages if you are using the recommended retina method of picturefill. When selecting a variation with an attached image it should replace the product image shown. Unfortunately, the way that WooCommerce replaces the image it is not compatible with the picturefill method... until now!
